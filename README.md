# Today-s-one-minute-market-data

Yahoo! finance

Python 2.7 program which reads data fom Yahoo! finance, for any stock symbol you enter, and outputs all the values of that stock for today.
The last data value is the very last stock price (most recent).
Data is per minute last time I checked.
This is open values, in the future will also add 'high', 'low' and 'close' options.
